# BePalmPlan-Events

This project includes backend, with `node.js`, `express` and frontend with `vanilla javascript`. The topic is Event and Attendee Management. There is:

- **landing page** that show what the user can do with the application, like search event by topic or location, filter the event byt some categories like travel, art or technology.
- **register page** where the user can register to the application
- **login page** where the user can login inside the application
- **home page** where the user can see the list of the events, can add favorite events and can search the event based on the topic or location, also can create new event
- **my event page** where the user can see which favorite or attend event has saved, and which event had created, the user can also modify or delete his/her created event
- **detail page of the event** where the user can see the details of an event and choose to attend to it

### Acceptance criteria:

- [x] Create a user model that stores information such as name, email, and hashed password.
- [x] Create an event model with information such as title, date, location, and description, and an array of attendees that will be user IDs.
- [x] Implement middleware that verifies the presence and validity of the token in protected routes.
- [x] Protect routes that allow actions exclusive to authenticated users.
- [x] File uploads (e.g., avatars or event posters).
- [x] Controllers that sort information based on some criteria.
- [x] Controllers that insert an element from one collection into another.
- [x] Implement a login form for users to enter the system. If a user does not exist, register a new one. Registration logs in the user after registering to save an unnecessary step.
- [x] Display a list of available events. Authenticated users will see additional options to create events and confirm attendance.
- [x] Allow users to explore details of each event and the list of attendees.
- [x] Implement proper error handling in the frontend and backend. All frontend forms have error control to inform the user of any issues.
- [x] All asynchronous processes show a loading indicator to the user to provide immediate feedback.
- [x] Focus on componentization, ensuring no code is repeated.
- [x] Fetch requests are reused through a single function, allowing all fetches to be made using the same method.

### BE Implementation:

We have two models: one for the users and one for the event.

## User model:

```javascript

  {
    username: { type: String, required: false },
    email: { type: String, required: true },
    password: { type: String, required: true },
    favoriteEvents: [
      { type: mongoose.Types.ObjectId, required: false, ref: "events" },
    ],
    attendEvents: [
      { type: mongoose.Types.ObjectId, required: false, ref: "events" },
    ],
    profileImg: { type: String, required: false },
  },
```

When registering and logging in the user, the library `bcrypt` is used to encrypt the password. The users have 2 array for storing favorite events and attend events, that are `Event` object.

## Event model

```javascript
    title: { type: String, required: true },
    description: { type: String, required: true },
    location: { type: String, required: true },
    date: { type: Date, required: true },
    category: {
      type: String,
      required: true,
      enum: ["hobbies", "art", "health", "travel", "sport", "social", "tech"],
    },
    attendees: [
      {
        type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
        required: false,
        ref: "users",
      },
    ],
    createBy: {
      type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
      required: true,
      ref: "users",
    },
    imgEvent: { type: String, required: true },
```

The event model has a `createBy` field that is the user who created the event and an array of `attendees` to have a list of user that will attend that particular event.

### Middleware

I implemented two middleware, one for uploading file in cloudinary and the other one for authenticate the user with a token, using `jsonwebtoken` library.

## Middleware for uploading file in cloudinary

```javascript
import multer from "multer";
import { v2 as cloudinary } from "cloudinary";
import { CloudinaryStorage } from "multer-storage-cloudinary";

const storage = new CloudinaryStorage({
  cloudinary: cloudinary,
  params: {
    folder: "BePalmPlan",
    allowedFormats: ["jpg", "png", "jpeg", "gif"],
  },
});

export const upload = multer({ storage });
```

### Middleware for authenticate the user

```javascript
import User from "../api/models/User.model.js";
import { isTokenBlacklisted } from "../utils/blacklistToken.js";
import { verifyToken } from "../utils/jtw.js";

export const isAuth = async (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    const token = req.headers.authorization;

    if (!token) {
      return res.status(401).json("Unauthorized");
    }

    const parsedToken = token.replace("Bearer ", "");

    if (isTokenBlacklisted(parsedToken)) {
      return res.status(403).json("Forbidden!");
    }

    const { id } = verifyToken(parsedToken);

    const user = await User.findById(id);

    user.password = null;
    req.user = user;

    next();
  } catch (error) {
    return next(error);
  }
};
```

### Utility functions

I implemented three utility functions, one for delete file from cloudinary, used when deleting an event, make sure that the file is also deleted in cloudinary, the other one is for verity and generate the token, and the last one is to set the token after the logout of the user in a blacklist.

## Delete file

```javascript
import { v2 as cloudinary } from "cloudinary";

export const deleteFile = (imgUrl) => {
  const splittedImg = imgUrl.split("/");
  const folderName = splittedImg.at(-2);
  const fieldName = splittedImg.at(-1).split(".");

  const public_id = `${folderName}/${fieldName[0]}`;

  cloudinary.uploader.destroy(public_id, () => {
    console.log("File deleted successfully!");
  });
};
```

## JTW file

```javascript
import jtw from "jsonwebtoken";

export const generateToken = (id) => {
  return jtw.sign({ id }, process.env.JWT_SECRET, { expiresIn: "1y" });
};

export const verifyToken = (token) => {
  return jtw.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
};
```

## Blacklist token

```javascript
const blacklistedToken = new Set();

export const blacklistToken = (token) => {
  blacklistedToken.add(token);
};

export const isTokenBlacklisted = (token) => {
  return blacklistedToken.has(token);
};
```

### FE Implementation:

## Landing page

It is the landing page for the BePalmPlan website, there is a here box to describe what the user can do with the application, the list of category of the events, the list of popular cities and a list of benefit the use can experience if they sign up. They user can sign up, if he/she is not yet register, or the user can login directly.

![Landing page](/Design/landing_page.png)

## Register page

It is a dialog where the user can register, entering a username, the email, the password and a profile picture. Call to the endpoint `/register`.

![Register dialog](/Design/register.png)

## Login page

It is a dialog where the user need to enter the email and the password to be logged in the application. Call to the endpoint `/login`.

![Login dialog](/Design/login.png)

## Home page

When the user is logged in, he/she will land to this page, it shows the event sorted by date. The user is able to filter by category, by the title of the event or the location. From the avatar, when clicking, there is a menu where the user can log out or land to the page where there are listed all the their events, favorite, hosting, attent or past. 

![Home page](/Design/home_page.png)

## Details page of the event

Clicking on one of the event, the use navigate to this page to see the details of a particular event. If the event was created by the logger user, the user could see two button to edit or delete this event

![Details event page](/Design/detail_event.png)

## My event page

In the page the user can see the list of the event is attending, hosting, favorite or past. The user is also able in this view to create a new event.

![My event event page](/Design/hosting_event.png)

## Create event dialog

This is the dialog for creating a new event
